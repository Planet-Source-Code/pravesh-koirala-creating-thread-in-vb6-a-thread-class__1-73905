## Creating Thread in VB6 \(A Thread Class\)


</div>

### Description

Create Threads in Visual Basic. It has a class called "Threads" which incorporates methods to create and manipulate a thread. It also includes a synchronization method (Semaphores) to coordinate your threads. Check it out, it comes with two examples.

1. File System Monitor

The monitor is basically the same as I had uploded the last time but with a major enhancement. It also comes with a class so that you can create your monitor easily.

2. File Encryption

This is a simple (By simple I mean simplest) file encryption example. It Xors a file byte by byte and saves to the disk. It is only meant to illustrate the Thread class and by no means an effective demonstration of File encryption (There are a lot more complex algorithms).

The code assumes you have fair understanding of MultiThreading and etcs. Also you must have at least created a thread with CreateThread API and crashed your IDE :-). (just joking)
